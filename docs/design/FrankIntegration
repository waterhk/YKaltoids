##### Usage : 

Run the project under the "AltoidsFrankified" scheme to use automation testing. 


##### Frank (Hornbill) Integration : 

Hornbill has been integrated with this tutorial : http://www.testingwithfrank.com/installing.html 
Screencast  :  http://vimeo.com/27691115
Following this tutorial would help Hornbill run locally ! 

But the tutorial suggests addinga  newTarget for the implementation, which is avoided, and done by adding a new configuration. 

##### Adding a new configuration - "Frankified"

We have 4 configurations now - Debug, Distribution, Release, and Frankified. 

The Frank Library is added to the the  Frankified configuration ONLY. 
The specific libraries are added to the Frankified configuration in the "OTHER LINKER FLAGS"  in BUILD SETTINGS.
The linker files have been added to the only the iOS Simulator.

##### Note: 

If this needs to be tested with the actual device, then the OTHER LINKER FLAGS will have to be added to the device section. 
But, according to the Frank documentaion, it may not work as intended, as it is still experimental.
